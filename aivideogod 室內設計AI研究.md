A hyper-realistic, cinematic drone photograph based strictly on the geography and layout of the provided satellite image. Transform the flat, top-down satellite view into a slight oblique angle (high-angle shot) to create three-dimensional depth.

The ground should not look flat; it must show realistic elevation changes and topography based on the image's features. Apply dramatic [Golden Hour sunrise/sunset)] lighting.

The low sun angle must cast long, distinct, directional

shadows from every tree, building, and hill, defining their shapes on the ground.

The light should be warm and rich. Add atmospheric haze and perspective, making distant elements slightly bluer and softer.

Enhance environmental textures: trees must be volumetric with individual leaves, water surfaces must be reflective, and roads/buildings must show realistic weathering and

material textures.

Shot on a high-resolution aerial cinema camera. incredible detail, sharp focus across the frame, natural cinematic color grading. Remove any text that was placed in google earth.

Act as a lead design architect performing a massing study. Your goal is to explore volumetric variations. Ignore all fenestration, materials, and fine details.

Focus solely on the overall form, silhouette, and relationship of solid volumes.

Using the general scale and footprint of the provided image as a starting constraint, manipulate the volume by applying additive principles. I want you to extrude the mass to create a structure that feels branched and creates moments of overhangs and permeable spaces.

ender the final output as an isometric conceptual model study. The entire structure must be visualized as monolithic, rough grey concrete with a brutalist texture, showing subtle imperfections and aggregate. It should be set against a seamless, infinite light grey studio background with soft, diffused lighting that casts gentle, grounding shadows.

Include a couple of tiny monochromatic scale figures next to the mass and inside the mass as well to emphasize its monumental scale.

The base volume is a one pitched roof shed type cabin. Use the reference image as a base start.

An architectural illustration of the image. The scene is presented as an isometric aerial view, looking down onto the entire development to show its massing and context.

The image must be rendered in a loose, naive, hand-drawn style using a thin black ink pen on white paper. The linework should be tremulous and jittery, avoiding any straight ruler lines. Incorporate corner overshoots where vertical and horizontal lines meet to emphasize the speed of the sketch. There are no grey washes, shadows, colors, or digital rendering effects; it is purely linework

The drawing must be densely populated with linework for entourage elements, including small scale figures, abundant vegetation on rooftops and ground levels, and street furniture

The vegetation should be depicted as abstract, scalloped cloud-shapes without internal detail. The people should be rendered as tiny, amorphous blobs and gestural outlines, lacking distinct limbs or faces. No hatches or textures.

The image must include several text annotations that blend seamlessly with the drawing style. The text should not look like a digital font. It must appear as spontaneous, hurried hand-lettering written with the exact same shakiness and ink flow as the architectural lines. The letters should be slightly irregular, naive all-caps doodles and describe different parts of the design use and elements.

The final result should feel like a charming, spontaneous "napkin sketch" or "doodle" that celebrates irregularity and imperfection, strictly in black and white.
