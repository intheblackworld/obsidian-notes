A hyper-realistic, cinematic drone photograph based strictly on the geography and layout of the provided satellite image. Transform the flat, top-down satellite view into a slight oblique angle (high-angle shot) to create three-dimensional depth.

The ground should not look flat; it must show realistic elevation changes and topography based on the image's features. Apply dramatic [Golden Hour sunrise/sunset)] lighting.

The low sun angle must cast long, distinct, directional

shadows from every tree, building, and hill, defining their shapes on the ground.

The light should be warm and rich. Add atmospheric haze and perspective, making distant elements slightly bluer and softer.

Enhance environmental textures: trees must be volumetric with individual leaves, water surfaces must be reflective, and roads/buildings must show realistic weathering and

material textures.

Shot on a high-resolution aerial cinema camera. incredible detail, sharp focus across the frame, natural cinematic color grading. Remove any text that was placed in google earth.

Act as a lead design architect performing a massing study. Your goal is to explore volumetric variations. Ignore all fenestration, materials, and fine details.

Focus solely on the overall form, silhouette, and relationship of solid volumes.

Using the general scale and footprint of the provided image as a starting constraint, manipulate the volume by applying additive principles. I want you to extrude the mass to create a structure that feels branched and creates moments of overhangs and permeable spaces.

ender the final output as an isometric conceptual model study. The entire structure must be visualized as monolithic, rough grey concrete with a brutalist texture, showing subtle imperfections and aggregate. It should be set against a seamless, infinite light grey studio background with soft, diffused lighting that casts gentle, grounding shadows.

Include a couple of tiny monochromatic scale figures next to the mass and inside the mass as well to emphasize its monumental scale.

The base volume is a one pitched roof shed type cabin. Use the reference image as a base start.
